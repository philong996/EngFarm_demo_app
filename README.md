# Speech Recognition for English Learners

## Overview

- The app can recognize accented or mispronounced speech, and the ability to provide meaningful evaluation of pronunciation quality.

- There are 3 important phrases:

    - Speech recognition: the app transcripes the audio into a sequence of words on the basis of internal phonetic and syntactic models.
    - Scoring: this phase makes it possible to provide a first, global evaluation of pronunciation quality in the form of a score.
    - Error detection: the system can locate the errors in the expression and indicate to the learner where users made mistakes.
